# got.predictions

## Setup

To run the code in this repository, Node (at least version 10) is needed. Additionally, to run the `predictor-neural` worker, make sure that Python (at least version 3.5) is installed and that you have the dependencies (i.e. run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in that directory).

Please run `npm install` after cloning the repository to install all dependencies or when the dependencies changed after pulling. Afterwards, use Visual Studio Code as your IDE to immediately start working with ESLint and Prettier being directly integrated then.
